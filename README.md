# Phase 2 Project: A Simple Travel App

## About the App:

Do you love to travel? Then you know that planning a trip is just as much work/fun as the trip itself. My simple travel app is meant to help plan, budget, and prepare for a fun vacation. 

## Features:
- Add in a new trip
- Add events for each trip
- Manage your trip budget

## Screenshots

## Technologies

Technologies used for this projects: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Boostrap, Semantic UI

## Setup

Run `$ npm install`, then `$ npm start` to open web app.

If you don't have `json-server` installed, run `$ npm i -g json-server`.

If you already have it installed, run the server by: `$ json-server --watch db.json`.

## Status

This projects will remain in progress as it is a passion project of mine. I am an avid traveller and have big dreams for where I can take this application as I learn more technologies
